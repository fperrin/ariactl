ariactl -- a Web interface for aria2

This is a small Perl script that uses using =Frontier::Client= to
communicate over XML-RPC with an instance of [[http://aria2.sourceforge.net/][=aria2=]].

It provides a webpage to add downloads to =aria2=, get the list of finished
and waiting downloads, and change some options of =aria2=.

Install =arialctl.pl= and the two CSS / JS files in a directory managed by
=mod_perl=. The script does no user authentication, configure your webserver
to limit access. Create a text file, =ariaurl.txt=, in order to find the URL
to use to contact =aria2='s XML-RPC server.

The URL to use will look like this:

    : http://rpc-token@machine.example.org:6800/rpc

On =machine.example.org=, start =aria2= with:

    : aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-secret=fasdhuklwer

If =aria2= is on another machine, you'll also want =--rpc-listen-all=. In that
case, you'll certainly want to have some access control in place to avoid
having =aria2= listening on the public Internet.
